# HYPER

HYPER is a 3D arcade endless arena shooter roguelike game with a variety of choices to upgrade your true love: your gun. The purpose is to survive as long as you can by upgrading your weapon in many creative ways so that you can kill monsters (in many creative ways). This is a 3 month dev challenge I'm doing through the summer, starting from 9 of June.

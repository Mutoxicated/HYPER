# HYPER

HYPER is a 3D arcade endless arena shooter game with a variety of choices to upgrade your true love: your gun. The purpose is to survive as long as you can by upgrading your weapon in many creative ways so that you can kill monsters (in many creative ways). This is a 3 month dev challenge I'm doing through the summer, starting from 9 of June. If you're interested in its development, here is the [devlog](https://github.com/Mutoxicated/HYPER/blob/main/devlog.md).

## How to open the game

Download the ZIP file and extract it into a folder. Then add that folder to your unity projects in Unity hub and then you can open the project. Make sure you have installed Unity version 2021.3.17f1, otherwise you might get some errors or something. Some commit versions might be unplayable because of missing prefabs... Sorry about that! I forget to update prefabs sometimes.

# Devlog

**This is a log of my entire development process of HYPER.**

## Day 1

Day 1 is as simple and dry as it can get. Creating the repository, project and just analyzing the concept.

## Day 2

Made the groundworks of the player today: movement, camera look, all that.
Movement is almost done.
The movement is very similar to ultrakill, but that's not intentional and is only because ultrakill just generally has good basic movement mechanics.
As I have stated in the description of the game, you will be able to upgrade your weapon with many different items.
Not only that, but certain items are categorized in different **classes**.
Classes can be synergized to create **synergized classes**.
Haven't thought a lot about the classes, so I'll think about them more on the following days.

## Day 3

Completed the movement. 
You can slide, jump, wall jump, ground slam, dash and, of course, walk.
Haven't implemented a limit to the wall jumps or a cooldown for the dash but I will do it eventually.
I took some time to think about the gameplay and here's what i'm thinking:
Of course, there will be the Arena, where you fight enemies in waves, but once the round ends, you go to the **Shop**.
The Shop is where you buy your upgrades. The upgrades are categorized in certain classes.
There are starter classes, synergized classes and HYPER-classes. Starter classes are what you start with, synergized classes can only be crafted with two starter classes.

### **STARTER CLASSES:**

1. INSANER (dps)
2. WARRIOR (defense)
3. MAGICIAN (magic)
4. SUMMONER (summoning stuff)

### **SYNERGIZED CLASSES:**

1. JUGGERNAUT = INSANER + WARRIOR 
2. WIZARD = INSANER + MAGICIAN 
3. ELEMENTOR = WARRIOR + MAGICIAN 
4. ALPHA TRAINER = INSANER + SUMMONER
5. SIGMA TRAINER = WARRIOR + SUMMONER
6. BETA TRAINER = MAGICIAN + SUMMONER

### **HYPER-CLASSES:**

idk :p

That's it for today.

## Day 4

So today I did a little bit of both analyzing gameplay and working on the game mechanics.
I made a quick weapon model in blender and put it together in Unity.
I also implemented some sort of inertia to the gun, so that whenever you move, it would sort of react to your movements by being slightly dragged.
And also shooting is semi-done, I only implemented the recoil and stuff, but yeah.
Very cool :)

Besides that, I also implemented some more important mechanics, those being the upgrades and the classes.
Though it's a VERY early prototype, so of course it's likely to change many many times.
That being said, here's an update on the classes:

So as you may know, upgrades are categorized in different classes (thought some upgrades can be categorized into two classes as well). Once you’ve had max items in a certain class, you can choose to synergize the class with another one (that you've also had max items), creating a synergized class. 

Each class has its own upgrade pool, but many upgrades can overlap with each other. Once you’ve upgraded to the synergized class, the game will randomly choose X/2 upgrades from the class’ upgrade pool to give you, where X is the class’ max amount of upgrades. Getting upgrades that overlap with another class that you don’t have requires you to sacrifice a starter class (if you have one, because they start getting pretty rare later, because of the item pool getting bigger).

With Starter classes, the max items there are on all of them is 4.
With Synergized classes, the max is 8.
And with Hyper classes, the max is 16.

I'm not gonna tell you the HYPER classes right now, but once they are done I will show.
Forgot to mention but HYPER classes can be crafted with synergized classes and any starter class.

But yeah that's it for today I'm kinda tired. 

## Day 5

Couldn't do anything to the game today for a few private reasons, but I did think about an important part of the whole structure of the game: the **Upgrade System**.
Here's how the Weapon System and the Upgrade System co-operate together:

The Weapon System contains Weapon stats and Weapon info. Weapon stats include stuff like bullet damage, fire rate, etc.
Meanwhile, Weapon Info includes members and methods like OnShoot(), current bullet pool, etc.
The Upgrade System has two types of Upgrades: Modifiers and Addifiers.
Modifiers modify the Weapon Stats, while Addifiers use stuff from Weapon Info to add stuff.
There's also the Upgrades class, which creates the Upgrades upon start-up and collects them in an array.
I'm still not too sure about this though, so expect things to change a lot.
I'm already thinking of making them scriptable objects... idk, anyway yeah that's it for today.

## Day 6

Added a new ability to the movement: lock.
You can lock yourself midair for a brief moment. Very cool imo.
I made a lot of changes in the upgrade system, realized scriptable objects don't really work well with what i'm trying to do, so instead i will just make each upgrade a prefab.
But yeah all around I just did some small refactoring and semi-implemented the upgrade system. It's really tough though because I have to make it versatile enough that it would satisfy my creativity.


A good example to what I am trying to do here is the Unity's Particle System. It has modules, that do different stuff and you can enable and disable them.
Unfortunately I don't think I can do the same thing the Particle System did, so I'm going for a different solutions.
I came up with different behaviours that upgrades will have in their prefabs.
There are Player, Bullet and Weapon behaviours. 

Anyway's I'm tired as hell so i'm just gonna buh bye.

## Day 7

Not a lot, just improving movement, getting rid of the static WeaponInfo class, because i just didnt have a great feeling about it, also created actual prefabs for the gun parts.
Also, i made the gun screw rotate 90 degrees when you shoot, looks very cool imo.
Again, didn't do anything crazy yet because I'm planning on thinking out the upgrades and shit, so yeah. There will be like 28 upgrades absolute minimum, so there's a lot to come up with.

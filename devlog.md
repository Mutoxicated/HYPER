# Devlog

This is a log of my entire devlopment process of HYPER.

### Day 1

Day 1 is as simple and dry as it can get. Creating the repository, project and just analyzing the concept.

### Day 2

Made the groundworks of the player today: movement, camera look, all that.
Movement is almost done.
The movement is very similar to ultrakill, but that's not intentional and is only because ultrakill just generally has good basic movement mechanics.
As I have stated in the description of the game, you will be able to upgrade your weapon with many different items.
Not only that, but certain items are categorized in different **classes**.
Classes can be synergized to create **synergized classes**.
Haven't thought a lot about the classes, so I'll think about them more on the following days.

### Day 3

Completed the movement. 
You can slide, jump, wall jump, ground slam, dash and, of course, walk.
Haven't implemented a limit to the wall jumps or a cooldown for the dash but I will do it eventually.
I took some time to think about the gameplay and here's what i'm thinking:
Of course, there will be the Arena, where you fight enemies in waves, but once the round ends, you go to the **Shop**.
The Shop is where you buy your upgrades. The upgrades are categorized in certain classes.
There are starter classes, synergized classes and HYPER-classes. Starter classes are what you start with, synergized classes can only be crafted with two (or more) starter classes.

**STARTER CLASSES:**

INSANER (dps)
WARRIOR (defense)
MAGICIAN (magic)
SUMMONER (summoning stuff)

**SYNERGIZED CLASSES:**

JUGGERNAUT = INSANER + WARRIOR 
WIZARD = INSANER + MAGICIAN 
ELEMENTOR = WARRIOR + MAGICIAN 
ALPHA TRAINER = INSANER + SUMMONER
SIGMA TRAINER = WARRIOR + SUMMONER
BETA TRAINER = MAGICIAN + SUMMONER

**HYPER-CLASSES:**
idk :p

That's it for today.

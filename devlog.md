# Devlog

This is a log of my entire devlopment process of Over v2.

### Day 1

Day 1 is as simple and dry as it can get. Creating the repository, project and just analyzing the concept.

### Day 2

Made the groundworks of the player today: movement, camera look, all that.
Movement is almost done.
The movement is very similar to ultrakill, but that's not intentional and is only because ultrakill just generally has good basic movement mechanics.
As I have stated in the description of the game, you will be able to upgrade your weapon with many different items.
Not only that, but certain items are categorized in different **classes**.
Classes can be synergized to create **synergized classes**.
Haven't thought a lot about the classes, so I'll think about them more on the following days.
